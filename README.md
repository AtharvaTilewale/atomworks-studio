Studio is a structure and annotation editor for [AtomWorks](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/atomworks)
annotated CIF files. Select atoms, attach conditioning annotations (sequence, coordinates, hotspots,
index groups and more), fix bonds and charges, protonate, edit chains and expandable segments, and save a
CIF that any Studio interface reopens. It is built for preparing inputs to structure-design models such as
[RFD4-Proteina](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFD4-Proteina). No model runtime or weights are needed.

## Features

- **One editor, three interfaces.** The browser, VS Code and native PyMOL share annotation definitions,
  editing operations, CIF storage and Undo.
- **Annotations you can see.** Pick a condition, apply it to a selection, and color or inspect the stored values.
- **Selections with AtomWorks queries.** Expressions such as `chain_id == 'A' & res_id > 50` work everywhere.
- **Structure edits with Undo.** Bonds, charges, pH-based protonation, chains, segments and validation.
- **Two renderers in the browser.** Mol* (WebGL) by default and Patinae (WebGPU), both bundled.
- **Design-ready examples.** Protein and small-molecule binders, antibody and nanobody CDRs, enzyme motifs,
  motif scaffolding, inverse folding and partial diffusion.
- **Optional Gradio host.** Adds generation controls around the same editor for hosted demos and Spaces.

## Install

Studio needs Python 3.12.

```bash
python -m pip install atomworks-studio
atomworks-studio
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>. The guide is at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/guide/>. Mol* and Patinae are
included in the package; Node and Rust are only needed to build from source.

## Use

Open a CIF, select atoms, and choose an annotation in **Edit → Annotations**. Inspect the stored values,
change bonds or charges, protonate, or edit chains and segments. **Save CIF** writes a file that opens in any
interface.

The PyMOL plugin offers the same controls natively, here on a nanobody design with a hotspot on the target:

See the [documentation](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/atomworks-studio/blob/main/docs/index.md) for selection syntax, interface guides, Python and HTTP
integration, and development notes.

## Build from source

```bash
make bootstrap
make test
make build
make run
```

The RFD4 annotation definitions and license are bundled in source and release builds and verified against the
SHA-256 hashes in `providers/rfd4/UPSTREAM.toml`. See [provenance](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/atomworks-studio/blob/main/docs/PROVENANCE.md).
